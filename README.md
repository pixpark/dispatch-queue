# DispatchQueue

A lightweight C++ task queue for executing tasks serially or concurrently on single or multiple threads. Supports both synchronous (`Sync`) and asynchronous (`Async`) operations, making it ideal for efficient task management in multithreaded applications.

---

## Features

- **Serial and Concurrent Execution**: Choose between `kSerial` (tasks run sequentially) or `kConcurrent` (tasks run in parallel).
- **Sync and Async Operations**: Use `Sync` for blocking tasks and `Async` for non-blocking tasks.
- **Thread Safety**: Built with `std::mutex` and `std::condition_variable` for safe concurrent access.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for adding and managing tasks.

## Usage

### Example Code

```cpp
#include "dispatch_queue.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Create a serial dispatch queue
    pixpark::DispatchQueue serial_queue(pixpark::DispatchQueue::kSerial);

    // Async example: Add tasks to the queue asynchronously
    serial_queue.Async([]() {
        std::cout << "Async task 1 is running on thread: " << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;
    });

    serial_queue.Async([]() {
        std::cout << "Async task 2 is running on thread: " << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;
    });

    // Sync example: Add a task to the queue synchronously
    serial_queue.Sync([]() {
        std::cout << "Sync task is running on thread: " << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;
    });

    // Wait for all tasks to complete
    serial_queue.Join();

    std::cout << "All tasks completed!" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Build and Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DispatchQueue.git
   cd DispatchQueue
   ```

2. Create a build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

3. Generate build files with CMake:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

5. Run the example:
   ```bash
   ./DispatchQueueExample
   ```

## API Overview

### DispatchQueue Class

- **`DispatchQueue(QueueType type)`**: Constructor to create a queue of type `kSerial` or `kConcurrent`.
- **`void Async(const std::function<void()>& task)`**: Add a task to the queue asynchronously.
- **`void Sync(const std::function<void()>& task)`**: Add a task to the queue synchronously and wait for it to complete.
- **`bool Busy()`**: Check if the queue is busy (tasks are running or waiting).
- **`void Stop()`**: Stop the queue and skip pending tasks.
- **`void Wait()`**: Wait for all tasks to start execution.
- **`void Join()`**: Wait for all tasks to complete.
